CPT and CPT2 are the exact same, I made two just in case

This program will not work unless the computer has a parallelport, since the code is designed to work with a motor and LEDs.

This code will only work if it is run in Turing 4.1.1 or Turing 4.1.2, since the files containing the code are ".t" (turing) files.

This was the final project for TEJ3M1.

The code allows the user to play a game of virtual archery, with the theme of Super Mario. 
The motor on the physical project follows where you move your aim, and the lights go on when you hit a target.
The code allows for the user to change the music, background, and timer, all in game.
